 * launch path that ui.show() starts, so every replica it hands to a hook - the first-run config, the options page's persist path - is read after the migration
 * has settled, and none of them can commit a pre-migration snapshot over it.
 *
 * A migration that composes a patch persists it to disk itself, without waiting for the user to press Save. Most people never open this panel to save
 * anything, so a migration that waited for one would leave a fleet split between two configuration shapes indefinitely, and the plumbing that reconciles them
 * could never retire. The write is gated on there being a patch, which is what bounds it: only a session that actually found legacy settings writes, so a
 * migrated install's every later open reads, finds nothing to do, and touches the disk not at all. The host's restart indicator therefore appears at most once
 * per install, in the single session that converts it.
 *
 * The weaker outcomes are deliberate. A save the deadline overtakes, and a save the host rejects, both leave the migration sitting in the modal's pending
 * configuration, where the user's own Save picks it up.
 *
 * Reopening the panel is convergent rather than racing. The settings frame is reused and each open imports a fresh copy of this module whose wiring runs
 * independently, but a second copy reads the saved configuration, finds no legacy keys in it, and so composes nothing and writes nothing. Two genuinely
 * simultaneous wirings read the same configuration and compose identical patches, so either ordering of their commits and saves leaves the same disk state.
 * A refresh click that lands before the envelope settles reads the degraded interpreter, whose canonical-prefix option scan answers for a migrated install,
 * and that window closes at settlement.
 *
 * One bound stated honestly: the check before the commit is the last cancellation point. A commit whose bridge round trip is already in flight cannot be
 * recalled - the session takes no signal, and the deadline bounds only the await - so composing the epoch into the signal narrows the stale-write window to
 * that in-flight instant rather than closing it. It is harmful only if a successor commits a differing edit inside the same instant, and two migration wirings
 * are convergent regardless.
 *
 * When the envelope fails, the interpreter settles at whatever the wiring reached. A catalog fetch that never succeeded leaves the degraded-mode interpreter in
 * place, which reads and writes the legacy properties, so the page still loads and first run still works; a migration that stumbled after the catalog arrived
 * keeps the catalog-backed interpreter, because one failed attempt is no reason to degrade every read for the session. The migration itself simply waits for a
 * session whose fetches succeed.
