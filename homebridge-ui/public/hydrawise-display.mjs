 * The suspended word is shown only where the runtime actually claimed suspension, which it does only on an account-credentialed install: the key-based wire gives a
 * suspended zone and a zone merely between runs identical bodies, so the runtime never guesses at the difference.
 *
 * The unscheduled word therefore claims exactly what remains - no upcoming run - and goes on covering a suspended zone wherever nothing could tell the two apart.

 * nextpoll excursion or a few minutes of clock skew never false-alarms, and tight enough that a dead runtime surfaces within minutes.

 * timezone - the epoch is the truth and each surface renders it honestly for its own reader.
