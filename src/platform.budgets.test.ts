 * platform.budgets.test.ts: The rate ceilings retrieve() enforces, exercised against a REAL platform whose undici traffic runs through a MockAgent
 * installed as the global dispatcher after construction. Pins the capacities the platform constructs its budgets at, which budget each endpoint draws against,
 * and - the pin the whole mechanism rests on - that both draws are AWAITED, by saturating a ceiling and proving the blocked call put nothing on the wire before
 * shutdown resolved it to the quiet null every caller of retrieve() expects.
 *
 * Draw ORDER (the command ceiling before the account ceiling) is deliberately not pinned here. The budgets are independent objects, so no order between them
 * is observable from outside without a production test hook this suite refuses to add; the order is a structural property of two adjacent awaits and is verified
 * by reading the diff, while what these tests verify is that each ceiling is independently enforced by an awaited draw.

 * correct implementation. A draw that was dispatched instead of awaited reaches the wire within a microtask or two, which is what this span is long enough to
 * catch. Both properties come from the same asymmetry, which is why the number is a settle window rather than a race.
