 * hydrawise-platform.options.test.ts: The platform's consolidated setting resolution and its guarded MQTT construction, exercised against a REAL platform built
 * through the harness. Covers every arm of the precedence rule - option over legacy property, legacy property over catalog default, and the explicit disabled and
 * valueless option states - for the API key, the MQTT broker URL, and the MQTT topic prefix, plus the client the resolved values do or do not construct.
 *
 * Every value pair here is deliberately distinct, so a resolver reading the wrong arm cannot echo the right answer back and pass.
