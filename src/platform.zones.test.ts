 * platform.zones.test.ts: The standalone zone accessory contract the platform owns - reconcileZoneAccessories and the discovery-time orphan sweep's
 * kind dispatch. Drives the reconcile directly against a real HydrawisePlatform (it is public API; the controller is its one production caller, but the contract
 * belongs to the platform) and drives the sweep through the captured DID_FINISH_LAUNCHING handler exactly as the discovery suite does.
 *
 * Covers the persistence-critical UUID seed, the accessory category and sanitized name, the exclusive context key set, the field-wise refresh comparison, the
 * demotion split between configuration intent and wire absence with its poll-count grace, per-controller isolation, and the per-zone promotion-failure
 * containment.
