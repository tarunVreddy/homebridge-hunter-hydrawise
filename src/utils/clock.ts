/**
 * clock.ts: The Clock port - the project's abstraction for time-dependent operations. Production code that needs to sleep, race a promise against a timeout,
 * or read the high-resolution clock should consume a Clock when those operations live inside an async chain that tests need to control deterministically. The
 * default realClock delegates to delay() and raceWithTimeout() in delay.ts and to performance.now() in the runtime; tests pass a fake-clock literal that
 * resolves sleeps instantly and chooses raceWithTimeout outcomes explicitly.
 *
 * Why this exists. Node's built-in node:test mock.timers exposes only synchronous tick() and runAll() - it has never shipped a tickAsync/runAllAsync variant
 * on any version. Synchronous tick advances the fake clock but does not drain microtask chains across nested Promise.race / .finally / await delay() patterns;
 * the promises stay pending past the tick. retryOperation is the canonical case: its internal raceWithTimeout -> Promise.race -> .finally -> await delay()
 * chain is exactly the shape mock.timers cannot deterministically resolve. Injecting a Clock sidesteps the runtime gap entirely - tests provide a sleep() that
 * resolves immediately and a raceWithTimeout() that forwards or rejects on demand.
 *
 * When to use a Clock vs. a direct delay()/raceWithTimeout() import. Use the direct imports when the production code's tests can fake time with mock.timers
 * and the call sites are shallow enough for synchronous tick() to drain. Reach for Clock injection only when nested async chains break that pattern, or when
 * the test surface needs to assert on the *schedule* (number and durations of sleeps) rather than just the eventual outcome.
 *
 * Project setup: this file expects a sibling `delay.ts` exporting `delay(ms: number): Promise<void>` and `raceWithTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, timeoutMs:
 * number, timeoutError?: Error): Promise<T>`. If the project does not yet have those primitives, create them (they're 5-10 lines each) before adopting this
 * port.
