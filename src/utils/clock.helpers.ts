 * clock.helpers.ts: Test affordance for the Clock port. The realClock default in clock.ts is the production-side adapter; makeFakeClock here is the test-side
 * counterpart - they form a pair, co-located so any test that consumes a Clock has the factory ready without inventing its own. By default the fake clock's
 * sleep() resolves immediately and records the requested duration into a shared array (so tests can assert on the schedule); raceWithTimeout() forwards the
 * inner promise unchanged (so the operation's own resolve/throw drives the outcome); now() returns 0. Tests that need different behavior pass overrides for
 * the specific method they want to control - e.g., a raceWithTimeout that throws synchronously to simulate the timer winning the race.
 *
 * Excluded from the build emit by tsconfig.build.json's dedicated src/utils entry, which carves out this whole directory; the *.helpers.ts glob there
 * matches this file too, but the directory-level entry already covers it.

/**
 * Builds a fake Clock plus a shared sleep-recording array. The default behavior is the right answer for almost every test:
 *
 *   - sleep(ms) resolves immediately and pushes ms into the sleeps array
 *   - raceWithTimeout(promise, ...) forwards the inner promise unchanged
 *   - now() returns 0
 *
 * Tests that need a different shape pass an override for that method only. Common overrides:
 *
 *   - `raceWithTimeout: async (_p, ms, err) => { throw err ?? new Error("timed out after " + String(ms) + "ms."); }` - simulates the timer winning the race
 *   - `now: () => 12345` - locks a deterministic timestamp for elapsed-time math
 *
 * @param overrides - Partial Clock to override the defaults for specific methods. Defaults to {}.
 * @returns A handle exposing the fake clock and the captured sleep durations.
