 * delay.ts: Async delay and timeout utilities. The Clock port (clock.ts) consumes raceWithTimeout and delay from this file as its production implementation;
 * any other code path that needs "promise with timeout" or a cancellable timeout should consume these directly rather than re-rolling the timer/promise/race/
 * cleanup sequence.
 *
 * Why these primitives are canonical: they exercise three patterns every project eventually needs - a cancellable timer with explicit cleanup, a single
 * timeout-race-with-cleanup implementation, and a named "sleep" wrapper around node:timers/promises.setTimeout. Centralizing them prevents the bug pattern
 * where timers are leaked because some call site forgot the .finally(clearTimeout).
