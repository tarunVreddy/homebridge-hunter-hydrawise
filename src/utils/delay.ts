 * delay.ts: Async delay and timeout utilities. The Clock port (clock.ts) consumes raceWithTimeout and delay from this file as its production implementation.
 * The platform's two HTTP transports take a different route for their own timeouts, composing AbortSignal.timeout() with composeSignals() from
 * homebridge-plugin-utils (platform.ts's retrieve() and v2.ts's requestSignal()/setZoneSuspension() admission wait) rather than drawing on these primitives.
 *
 * Why these primitives are canonical: they exercise patterns every project eventually needs - a cancellable timer with explicit cleanup, a timeout-race-
 * with-cleanup implementation, and a named "sleep" wrapper around node:timers/promises.setTimeout. Centralizing them prevents the bug pattern where timers
 * are leaked because some call site forgot the .finally(clearTimeout).
