 * loggers.helpers.ts: Logger doubles handed to code under test in place of the production logger. silentLog drops every call (used when production code logs
 * but the test isn't asserting on output); capturingLog records every call (used when the test does want to assert on log output). Both satisfy the TestLogger
 * interface, which mirrors the public surface of the project's production logger.
 *
 * Two project adaptations from the canonical copy are applied here. First, the debug channel is message-first (`debug(message, ...args)`) to match Homebridge's
 * Logging and homebridge-plugin-utils' HomebridgePluginLogging, whose debug signature carries no leading category; the platform constructor reassigns `.debug` in
 * place, so the captured shape must mirror production's calls or every captured debug line is corrupt. Second, the bound-logger method is dropped entirely,
 * because this plugin prefixes through the prefixedLog wrapper rather than a logger method, so TestLogger has no bound-logger surface to model.
 */

 * satisfies this shape so it can stand in for the production logger.
