/**
 * Registers a per-test handler that fails the test if any unhandled promise rejection occurs during the test body. Use this for tests of code that fires
 * fire-and-forget promises ("void this.refresh()") - without a guard, a rejection in one of those promises would surface as a Node-level warning rather than a
 * test failure. The returned cleanup function must be invoked from t.after() or afterEach() to remove the handler.
 *
 * The emitter parameter exists for testability - tests pass a fresh EventEmitter so synthetic events do not conflict with the test runner's own
 * unhandledRejection guard. Production callers omit it and the helper attaches to process.
 *
 * @param emitter - The emitter to listen on. Defaults to process. Tests pass a controlled emitter to avoid runner conflicts.
 * @returns A cleanup function that detaches the handler and throws an AggregateError if any rejection was captured.

 * introducing real-time delays. The default budget is 100 iterations, which is more than enough for any code path that resolves within a finite microtask
 * chain. Tests that need to wait on real timers should use mock.timers.tick() (after enabling timer mocking via mock.timers.enable()), not this helper.

 * @returns The first non-undefined value the predicate returns.
