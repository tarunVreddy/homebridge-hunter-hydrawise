 * hap.helpers.ts: A hand-built HAP test-double - the Service and Characteristic marker namespaces, TestCharacteristic, TestService, and TestAccessory - that
 * mirrors only the HAP surface the plugin actually touches. homebridge-plugin-utils' REAL acquireService / validService / getServiceName / setServiceName run
 * unmodified against these doubles, so a REAL HydrawiseController is constructed end to end with no live HAP runtime.
 *
 * The doubles carry the identity surface those helpers key on, so naming behaves as it does against real HAP. TestService exposes the whole service namespace as
 * cross-kind statics, which is what the helpers' name-set initializer reads off a service's constructor to decide whether a kind supports the ConfiguredName and
 * Name characteristics, and TestCharacteristic - the single wrapper class every characteristic instantiates, and therefore the constructor the helpers recover
 * from a service's first characteristic - exposes the name-characteristic kinds as statics. A Valve consequently takes both name characteristics and an
 * IrrigationSystem takes Name alone, exactly as against real HAP, and getServiceName reads back what setServiceName wrote.
 *
 * Every characteristic write is recorded on its service along with the kind written, so a test can assert that a particular characteristic was or was not
 * written across a window without reasoning about the routine writes a polling pass performs.
 *
 * Consumed surface (swept from homebridge-plugin-utils/src/service.ts and the plugin source): a service exposes UUID, subtype, displayName (mutable),
 * characteristics (the public array getCharacteristicConstructor destructures), optionalCharacteristics, addOptionalCharacteristic, testCharacteristic,
 * getCharacteristic, updateCharacteristic, and removeService's target shape; a characteristic exposes UUID, value, updateValue, onGet, onSet, and
 * the triggerGet / triggerSet test knobs; an accessory exposes context, displayName, _associatedHAPAccessory, services, addService, getService,
 * getServiceById, and removeService.
