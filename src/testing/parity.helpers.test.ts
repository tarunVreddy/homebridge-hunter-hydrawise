/**
 * parity.helpers.test.ts: Tests for the factory-parity utilities. assertSameShape and declareKeysOf together form the runtime + compile-time pair that
 * catches silent drift between a fixture factory and its target type. The test file pins assertSameShape's reporting contract (asymmetric difference, descriptive
 * label embedding, no-op on equal sets); declareKeysOf's contract is fundamentally compile-time so we exercise it with a representative type and verify the
 * runtime return-as-passed-through behavior.
