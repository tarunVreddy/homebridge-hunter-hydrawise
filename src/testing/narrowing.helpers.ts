/**
 * Returns the first element of an array, throwing if the array is empty. The returned value is narrowed from `T | undefined` (the type produced by indexed
 * access under noUncheckedIndexedAccess) to `T` in one call, declaring the "expected at least one" precondition at the helper boundary rather than scattering
 * a destructure-and-assert.ok dance at every site. The thrown error includes the label so failed assertions point at the specific kind of array that was
 * empty (e.g., "write", "execFile call").
 *
 * The alternative without this helper:
 *
 *   const [first] = items;
 *   assert.ok(first);
 *   first.field;
 *
 * Both narrow correctly; firstOf collapses the three lines into a labeled call.
 *
 * @param items - The array to read from. Read-only because the helper does not mutate.
 * @param label - Optional descriptive label folded into the error message when the array is empty (e.g., "write", "execFile call"). Defaults to "item".
 * @returns The first element, narrowed to T.
 * @throws Error when the array is empty.

 * Returns the element at the given index, throwing if the array does not extend that far. Same rationale as firstOf but for indexes other than 0 - in tests
