 * platform.helpers.ts: The plugin-specific test harness - the platform double for controller tests, the API double for real-platform construction, the recording
 * MQTT client, the programmable retrieve recorder, the undici MockAgent installer, and the buildController / buildPlatform construction workhorses. Every cast
 * that bridges a double to a production constructor's parameter type is confined to a workhorse, so test bodies stay cast-free.
 *
 * Two wire boundaries by design. Controller tests never touch undici: the platform double's retrieve is a programmable recorder that records every call and
 * returns fixture-programmed response shapes. Platform tests construct a REAL HydrawisePlatform and drive its retrieve() through a MockAgent installed as the
 * global dispatcher after construction, so the real status-code classification and error taxonomy run unchanged.

// a Node below the release that ships them. It is a no-op on a runtime that already has them, and the runtime-floor conformance test enumerates it among the lines
// the sunset deletes.
