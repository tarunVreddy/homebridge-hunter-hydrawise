 * hap.helpers.test.ts: Self-test for the HAP double. Pins that the REAL homebridge-plugin-utils service helpers (acquireService, validService, getServiceName,
 * setServiceName) run unmodified against the marker namespaces - the seeded first characteristic lets getCharacteristicConstructor recover a constructor without
 * throwing, and the cross-kind statics let the name predicates answer per kind the way they do against real HAP - and that the characteristic trigger knobs, the
 * write recorder, the service accessors, and the accessory accessors behave as production expects.
