 * controller.suspension.test.ts: The per-zone suspension switches - where they exist, where they must not, what they show, and what a tap on one does. Covers the
 * creation gate and the subtype the sweep depends on, the name resynchronization a zone rename drives, the optimistic command and its revert, the command guard
 * that keeps a snapshot older than the user's own tap from undoing it, the account-wide command's per-zone stamp, and the subtype-scoped sweep that must never
 * touch the account-wide switch it shares a service type with.
 *
 * Every command runs against the platform double's recording suspension surface, so no test here reaches the account API or its client - the client's own
 * admission and transport behavior is pinned in its suite, and what this one pins is the projection above it.
