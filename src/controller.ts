   * the behaviorally right answer where a raw read would be wrong - a zone the user forced into a manual run classifies as running, so the switch reads off while
   * water flows, exactly as the wire heuristic reads today. The command-recency condition closes the other half: a snapshot fetched before the user's own command
   * cannot know about it, and letting one answer here would flip the switch straight back.
   *
   * Otherwise the wire heuristic stands. Every zone carrying the unscheduled sentinel with no sensor stop is the strongest evidence the key-based wire offers for
   * a suspend-all, and it is what the API itself normalizes a suspend-all command to. It carries two documented ambiguities: it cannot tell a suspend-all from an
   * account whose every zone merely sits between runs, so the switch can read on with nothing commanded; and on a controller whose rain sensor covers every zone
   * it reads OFF during a genuine suspend-all, because the sensor classification claims those zones first - a 2026-08-04 live capture recorded exactly that. The
