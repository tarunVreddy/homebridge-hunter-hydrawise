 * platform.hardware.test.ts: The platform's optional account-credentialed enrichment, exercised against a REAL HydrawisePlatform whose client is a recording
 * double, so the credential gate, the refresh loop's single start, and the distribution all run production code with no cloud call of any kind.
 *
 * Two things are being told apart throughout. The GATE decides whether a client exists at all, and it answers to the configured credentials; the DISTRIBUTION
 * decides which controller receives which facts, and it answers to the correlation id v1 and the account API agree about. A test that conflated them could pass
 * with the wrong controller enriched.
 *
 * What these tests deliberately do NOT wait on is the loop's quarter-hour sleep. Node's test-runner timer mocking cannot advance a promisified timer at all - the
 * gap this package's own Clock utility documents - so the second tick is driven through the production refresh method directly, and the sleep between ticks is
 * covered by the constants receipt in the settings suite rather than by a test that would have to wait it out.
