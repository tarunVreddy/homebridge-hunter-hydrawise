/* A feature option entry for this plugin's catalog. Scope levels are the framework's own vocabulary: "controller" addresses a whole controller and every zone beneath

 * owns - which views an option renders on, and which levels it resolves at - and the runtime narrows its lookups against the option-name unions below.
 *
 * We close the base type's optional-scopes hole so every catalog entry must declare its levels: an entry that forgets them fails to compile rather than silently
 * becoming valid everywhere. An intersection with the base type does not work here - TypeScript resolves an intersected mutable-plus-readonly property as writable -
 * so we Omit the base declaration and redeclare it both required and readonly. The tuple is non-empty by construction, since an option declaring no level at all would
 * render nowhere and resolve nowhere.

 * the plugin schedules and controls; the account login unlocks a second, read-only surface that reports details the key-based API does not carry, so leaving the
 * login unset costs nothing beyond those details.
 *
 * The key and the password declare themselves secret, so the settings page renders them masked behind a reveal the user operates. The username does not: it is an
 * email address, it is not a credential on its own, and masking it would only make a field the user needs to read back harder to check. Masking is a presentation
 * choice about who can read the screen, not protection at rest - all three land in config.json as plain text like every other option value.
 *
 * The catalog order is the settings page's render order, so it is deliberate rather than alphabetical: the key first as the required credential, then the login
 * pair in the order a sign-in form reads - username, then password.
