 * controller.hardware.test.ts: The controller's projection of optional hardware facts onto HomeKit's AccessoryInformation service. The design under test is
 * cache-resident: the characteristics are the only store these facts have, so every pin here is a claim about what a characteristic READS after a construction or
 * an enrichment, never about a parallel copy.
 *
 * That makes the pre-seeded value the whole method. HAP round-trips characteristic values through Homebridge's accessory cache, so a warm restart begins with real
 * values already in place - the double models this by seeding each kind with HAP's own registered default and letting a test write over it. A test that started
 * from an empty accessory could not tell "preserved the cached value" from "wrote nothing anywhere", which is exactly the distinction this design turns on.
