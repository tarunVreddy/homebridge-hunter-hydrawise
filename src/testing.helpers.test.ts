/**
 * testing.helpers.test.ts: Tests for the cross-cutting testing-helpers barrel. The barrel is the canonical import path for tests outside `src/testing/`
 * (enforce this with a project-specific ESLint rule - see `test-conventions.md` §8 Barrel-Only Import Discipline). These tests pin the barrel's runtime export
 * surface so a forgotten re-export, a renamed submodule symbol, or an unintended addition surfaces immediately at unit-tier rather than as a confusing import
 * error in some downstream test file.
 *
 * Three checks form a symmetric drift catch:
 *
 *   1. Every documented symbol IS re-exported (catches missing re-exports - a submodule export the barrel forgot to forward).
 *   2. No undocumented runtime exports exist (catches accidental additions - a submodule export that flowed through without being documented).
 *   3. Cardinality matches (catches same-size swap - one removed, one added would pass the first two tests by accident).
 *
 * When the barrel grows or shrinks, update the EXPECTED_*_EXPORTS lists below to match.
