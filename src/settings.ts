 * automation cannot hammer a throttle Hydrawise does not publish. It is also the whole of the policy - what a burst of commands may spend is this constant and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The arithmetic is worth stating plainly, because independent ceilings do add up: an hour in which commands and reads both run to their limits admits more v2

 * and a command that queued for it would take effect long after the user had walked away. Giving up inside a second turns contention into a switch that flicks back
