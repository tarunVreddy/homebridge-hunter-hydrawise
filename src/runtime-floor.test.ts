 * runtime-floor.test.ts: The engines-keyed conformance guard for this plugin's explicit-resource-management gesture. While the package's `engines.node` floor sits
 * below the Node release that ships DisposableStack, AsyncDisposableStack, and SuppressedError as platform globals, this suite asserts that the entry point
 * installs them as its FIRST import, ahead of anything that could construct a stack, and that the test harness mirrors the same install for the suites that
 * construct the platform without ever loading the entry point. The moment the floor is bumped to that release, the live assertion fails with an enumerated cleanup
 * list - the anti-forget mechanism that turns "delete the polyfill gesture" from a thing to remember into a thing the suite demands.
 *
 * One residual is accepted and stated rather than papered over. Node runs each test file in its own process, so a suite that constructed the platform without
 * transiting the harness module would run unpolyfilled on a sub-floor runtime. Every construction workhorse does transit it, and the presence and position pins
 * below are the mechanical guards that keep it that way; what no test here can do is exercise the sub-floor path itself, because the runtime running this suite is
 * above the floor and already supplies the globals.
