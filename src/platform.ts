   * once per poll and hosts each zone's valve from the map it returns, so the hosting decision and the pruning decision read one source of truth.
   *
   * The inputs are deliberately different populations, and the difference is what makes configuration intent and wire absence tellable apart. `zones` is the
   * REQUEST - one entry per zone that should be standalone right now, carrying the zone's effective display name and its wire identity. `presentRelayIds` is
   * EVERY zone the poll's report carried, before any enablement filtering. A zone the wire still reports but the request omits can only be a configuration
   * change, so it is demoted at once; a zone missing from both is a wire absence, which is graced for a few polls because a transient flake must never destroy a
   * HomeKit identity the user placed in a room.
   *
   * The flush shape differs by arm, and every one of them is strictly on-change. A demotion flushes the whole array through removeAccessory's own tail, while a
   * creation or a context refresh flushes just its accessory. A poll on which a zone is renamed on the wire can therefore produce this context flush and the
   * controller's own accessory-name flush for the same accessory - two flushes on one rename poll, self-limiting and accepted.
   *
   * This method never touches a service: what lands on a hosted accessory is the controller's business.
   *
   * @param options - The owning controller, the id set of every zone the poll reported, and the standalone request.
