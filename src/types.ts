 * A running zone sits outside the group deliberately. Forcing a manual run during a genuine rain delay is plausible, so a running zone is evidence either way and
 * settles nothing; leaving it out keeps sensor precedence - the standing tiebreak wherever this wire is ambiguous - rather than letting one manual run reclassify
 * every covered sibling.
 *
 * Callers pass a zone drawn from the same response's relay list. A zone carrying the unscheduled shape is never running, so it always belongs to any covering
 * sensor's group and the group walk is never empty. This is the one home for the rule: the controller's own check and the schedule projection below both resolve
 * here, so the log the operator reads and the projection the webUI reads cannot disagree. One limit is worth naming - an account whose every covered zone carries
 * the shape reads the same whether a sensor stopped it, the owner suspended all of it, or every zone merely sits between runs, and sensor precedence decides it.

/* Project a wire zone onto its persisted schedule state, through ordered exits that weigh the wire, the account's facts, and a suspension command the account

 *
 * RUNNING is asked first, and it is the only reading no other witness can overturn. Water demonstrably flowing is the strongest fact anyone here holds, and a
 * running zone never presents the unscheduled shape - it always carries a run - so asking it first moves no classification that the shapes below would have
 * claimed.
 *
 * A STANDING SUSPEND COMMAND answers next, for ANY wire shape rather than only the ambiguous one. The account has just accepted the command, and the poll
 * snapshot in hand was taken before it: a zone still reporting a live schedule is exactly the case this arm exists for, because the wire cannot yet know what
 * the account has agreed to. Every command reaching here is already known to be STANDING - the caller decides that, which is what keeps this module clock-free.
 *
 * The SENTINEL branch then owns the ambiguous shape, the one body the key-based wire cannot read further, where a suspension, a rain stop, and a plain absence
 * of scheduling look identical. A suspension the facts report wins outright, then a suspension carried forward from the prior projection, then a sensor stop -
 * the facts' own live reading where they carry one, the group inference where they do not - and an unscheduled zone is what remains. A positive "the sensors are
 * quiet" answer is deliberately NOT followed by the group inference: the account API has looked at the sensor itself, which is better evidence than reading the
 * shape of a group. Suspension outranks the sensor claim because it is the longer-lived, user-created fact; the sensor's claim returns on its own the moment the
 * suspension clears.
 *
 * A standing RESUME travels the other direction and acts as SUPPRESSION rather than as a claim of its own: it silences both suspension arms inside that branch
 * and lets the zone fall through to the sensor test, because resuming a zone does not call off a rain delay. On any other shape a resume is naturally silent,
 * since no suspension arm would have fired there anyway.
 *
 * The remaining exits are the wire's own unambiguous readings: the sentinel reached HERE still carries a run or a schedule string, so it is simply unscheduled;
 * and everything else is scheduled, its next run being the root time plus the seconds the wire reports until it.
 *
 * Every time-bearing arm stores ABSOLUTE epoch seconds, and that is what makes the projection stable across polls: the wire's countdowns fall as the poll clock
 * rises, so each sum holds still until the schedule genuinely moves. Storing the countdowns themselves would move every field on every poll and turn each poll into
 * a cache write.
 *
 * With no facts, no carried suspension, and no command the whole path collapses to the key-based classification, which is what keeps an install without account
 * credentials reading exactly as it always has.

/* The typed HomeKit accessory context this plugin persists on every accessory it owns. Homebridge round-trips this object verbatim through its on-disk cache, so it
 * holds only plain, JSON-serializable data the webUI can read back with zero cloud calls.
 *
 * The context carries two distinct persisted kinds side by side, each with its own types, its own guards, and its own flush discipline. Stable identity - the
 * self-identity, the denormalized account roster, the zone roster, and the zone-accessory pair - answers who a thing is, and its types never carry volatile fields.
 * The schedule projection answers what a controller's zones are doing; it is volatile by subject but change-shaped by construction, storing absolute instants that
 * hold still between polls, so it is written on the same compare-then-write terms identity is. Both are read straight off the accessory cache, which is what keeps
 * the webUI's listing and its schedule display free of any cloud call.
 *
 * The accessory KINDS are mutually exclusive, and the arms below state that in the types rather than leaving it to convention. A controller accessory carries
 * its own identity (the self-identity the webUI's zone lookup keys on), the denormalized account roster (every account controller, enabled or not, so any one
 * accessory knows all its siblings), its own zone roster, and its schedule projection; it never carries the zone-accessory pair. A standalone zone accessory carries
 * exactly that pair - the owning controller's identity and the zone's own - and never any controller-accessory field. Each arm types the other kind's fields as
 * `never`, so an object carrying both shapes at once inhabits neither. That split is what the webUI's controller match rests on: it finds a controller by reading
 * `controller`, so a zone accessory carrying that field would shadow the real controller accessory and blank the zone listing.
 *
 * The arms are deliberately asymmetric in what they require. Every controller-arm field is optional, so a freshly constructed `{}` and a cache entry carrying only
 * some of the fields both inhabit that arm, and an ambiguous or empty context classifies as controller-side - the self-healing direction, and the same answer the
 * runtime predicate gives. The zone arm requires its pair, because that pair is only ever written as one whole object.
 *
 * The write discipline follows from the aliases rather than from a rule each writer has to remember. HydrawiseAccessoryContext composes READONLY views of the arms,
 * so a reference typed as the union admits a whole-object assignment and rejects a field write outright, while every field write lives on an arm-typed reference,
 * which carries the mutable interface. isZoneAccessoryContext below is the runtime half of the same rule and the vocabulary every consumer branches on: it asserts
 * the split against cache JSON that no static type governs, and it narrows both of its branches.
