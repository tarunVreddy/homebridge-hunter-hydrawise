 * platform.suspension.test.ts: The platform's per-zone suspension surface, exercised against a REAL HydrawisePlatform. The client under it is a REAL
 * HydrawiseV2Client built over an injected MockAgent and sharing the platform's own rate budgets, so the whole path - the platform's zero-cost pre-check, the
 * client's admission phase, the transport - runs production code with nothing ever reaching the account API.
 *
 * The pre-check and the admission bound are deliberately told apart here. The pre-check answers the COMMON saturated case for free and carries a check-then-act
 * race of its own; the client's admission window is what bounds the loser of that race. A suite that drove only the fast path would pass against an
 * implementation whose race loser blocked for the length of the budget's own window.
 *
 * Which ceiling a fixture drains is the whole meaning of these tests, so each one says so. A command's admission draws the COMMAND ceiling, while the token grant
 * it may need draws the READ ceiling alongside the scheduled reads, and a saturation staged against the wrong one of those would prove nothing about the path it
 * claims to be testing.
